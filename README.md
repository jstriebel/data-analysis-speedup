Material for my talk at the [PyConDE & PyData Berlin 2022](https://2022.pycon.de/program/VYS8XY/)

## Description

Your data analysis pipeline works. ***Nice.***<br/>
Could it be faster? ***Probably.***<br/>
Do you need to parallelize? ***Not yet.***

We'll go through optimization steps that **boost the performance of your data analysis pipeline on a single core**, reducing time & costs. This walkthrough shows tools and strategies to identify and mitigate bottlenecks, and demonstrate them in an example. The 5 steps cover:

* Identifying bottlenecks: Profiling
* Efficient IO
* Vectorization
* Memory & Precision Tradeoffs
* Jit-ting with numba

This talk is suited for data scientists on a beginner and intermediate level, typically working with a numpy/scipy/â€¦ stack or similar. The talk gives strategies & concrete suggestions how to speed up an existing analysis pipeline, which is demonstrated practically on an example, showing the gained speed & memory improvements of each step.
